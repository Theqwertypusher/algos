one sentence descriptions of algorithms and patterns
bubble, selection nested loops to check for highest value or lowest value
insertion sorts - iterates array and sorts the array left of the iterator
merge sort - uses helper function to merge; recursion to split 
quick sort - uses helper pivot function initially based on last element. 
Swaps all numbers less and returns index which is the index that is sorted. 
Quick sort. Recursively calls pivot before and after the initial pivot index. And returns arr
