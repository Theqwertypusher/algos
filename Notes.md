Learning requires: Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creating 

### One Sentence Explanations

- Big O Notation: how we describe an algorithm as the input gets arbitraryily large 
    - Time Complexity:
    - Space Complexity:  
- Sorting Algorithms
    - Bubble/Selection sort: nested loops to check for highest value or lowest value
    - Insertion sort: iterates array and sorts the array left of the iterator
    - Merge sort: uses merge help function and recursion to split 
    - Quick sort: uses pivot helper function and recursion to pivot all elements
- Data Structures
    - Queue
    - Stack
    - Linked List: a chain of nodes where each node contains data and points to the subsequent node in the chain
        - Singly Linked List: 1 way node chain
        - Doubly Linked List: 2 way node chain
            - Algorithms:
                - Reverse a Linked List: Swap head and tail then iterate using next and previous pointers to build backwards
    - Binary Search Tree 
    - Graphs 
    - Binary Heaps
    - Hash Tables 
- Algorithm Patterns
    - Sliding Window
    - Two Pointers
